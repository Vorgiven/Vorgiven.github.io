    <h1> Types of Cats</h1>
    <h2 class="lefttext"> Exotic Cats</h2>
  <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/-Tzz0bHU19DIaFQg15bPt_lEZ_0=/2082x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/exotic-shorthair-cat-resting-on-floor-585840669-5ad0afd7c064710038e382e7.jpg>
    <a>People who love the look and sweet personality of the Persian, but who don't care to be a slave to daily brushing, <br><br>will find exotic cats the perfect pet.

Selectively bred to develop the short plush coat, the exotic in every other way resembles the Persian, including its quiet, affectionate disposition.</a>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2 class="lefttext" > Persian Cat</h2>
      <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/CVE6us10e52PsnEDR7nohkVqVxw=/2082x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brown-persian-cat-laying-on-edge-of-green-carpet-456750383-581211b53df78c2c7320b40b.jpg>
    <a>With its glorious long flowing coat and sweet face to match its disposition, it is no wonder Persian cats are the favorite cat among all pedigreed breeds. Persians require a secure, serene environment, but once they feel safe, they will be a constant source of pleasure to the lucky household that is owned by a Persian.
<br> <br>
The Persian requires regular maintenance to keep the beauty of that coat, so consider carefully before making what should be a lifetime commitment to this glorious cat.</a>
    <br> <br>
      <h2 id=mainecoon> Maine Coon</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/7FVx8XBhlTXvzWUhpDRdyxjEgzQ=/2122x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Brother-SisterMaineCoon_Nina-Pearman2122x1415-56a112a83df78cafdaa926f5.jpg>
    <a> Although named after the raccoon, contrary to popular folklore, the Maine Coon cat is not the result of a cat breeding with a raccoon; more likely is the story of a cross between an American domestic cat and a long-haired cat (possibly an Angora), brought by ship from Europe.
<br> <br>
Equally at home with children, dogs, or older persons, the Maine Coon is an ideal pet, handily earning its status as the second most popular breed in America, as well as it's fond nickname, "The Gentle Giant."</a>
    
    <br> <br> <br>
    
     <h2 id=ragdoll> Ragdoll Cats</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/b97wPUpV0zEZo7FDzc-poF8yAP0=/1509x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-RagdollCatCasper5137x3424-577ef1195f9b5831b59cc053.jpg>
     <a> Ragdoll cats are said to have been named for their proclivity to relax entirely when held. The Ragdoll adores its humans and would generally prefer to be wherever you are. Don't be surprised to have a Ragdoll shadow as you go from room to room, talking to you in her sweet musical voice.</a>
 
<br> 
    
     <h2 id=british> British Shorthair Cat</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/Rl3iamEmZ1WBHjTPNcP4ttmBCNQ=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/close-up-of-cat-sleeping-on-couch-660560353-5911fbb55f9b586470b7af37.jpg>
     <a>  British Shorthair cat was the only pedigreed cat featured at the first cat shows, and it is considered to be the oldest English breed. While moderately active, they are ideal household cats and are known to be equally at home with children and other pets. 

While this shorthaired breed is often seen in blue, the cats come in a rainbow of other colors. </a>
    
    <br> <br>
    
    <h2 id=american> American Shorthair</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/wp9ALbuVoRMbjDw-60OucQ3XdcQ=/2334x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tabby-cat-lying-in-the-sun-527997476-59107d5b5f9b586470cde64b.jpg>
     <a> The American Shorthair was one of the first five breeds recognized by the CFA, and was originally called the "Domestic Shorthair." If you are looking for a low maintenance cat, the American Shorthair is right up your alley.
<br> <br>
They are solidly built cats, descendants of ancestors who arrived from Europe with the early pioneers, and are full-fledged All-American cats, just as the descendants of those human pioneers are All-Americans today. </a>
    <br><br>
    
    
     <h2 id=abyssinian> Abyssinian</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/Pt8l2m0ZPjnIaklKW8zW2YBUQCI=/1629x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/rosso-165827729-591080203df78c9283d0f306.jpg>
     <a> The Abyssinian, fondly called the Aby, is a lively and active cat. Many Abyssinians love water. Be prepared to provide plenty of interactive play for an Aby cat, and you will be rewarded with lifetime loyalty. If you have energy, humor, and zest for life, an Aby might become your best friend.</a>
    

    
 <h2 id=sphynx> Sphynx</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/KOn0yHBp9zGZEajBSPE5RlxN8as=/1593x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sphynxcat-on-a-vintage-chair-578970031-591080af5f9b586470ce0e21.jpg>
     <a> With its almost hairless body, big ears and pixie-ish expression, you'll either love or hate it at first sight. If you spend a bit of time around a Sphynx, you'll find them companionable, intelligent, and friendly-- all those qualities one looks for in a pet. Sphynx are outgoing and love to show off, which makes them always sought out in shows.</a>
    
     <h2 id=siamese >Siamese Cats</h2>
    <img class=images src=https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/RhSzSXwI4b1Pipha4MuHzOekiBo=/1733x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Stocksy_txpe3e966aau8r100_Medium_1128816-5a9426131d64040037fe58bc.jpg>
     <a>Although the breed standard has changed significantly over the years, Siamese cats, fondly known as "Meezers," remain high in popularity for people looking for a pedigreed pet. Whether it be classic, traditional, or modern, hundreds of thousands of cat lovers say, "Make mine Siamese, if you please."</a>
    
    
    <h2 id=scottish> Scottish Fold</h2>
    <img class=images src = https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/s6be-SddF6GpVYUNR6v3Ixy7wfQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/scottish-fold-scratch-post-5a0f4ad3494ec9003791fe3b.jpg >
    
     <a> While the Scottish Fold cat has a look all its own, the occasional kitten will have perfectly straight ears. This is normal, although those cats who are shown are the ones with the forward-folding ears. Even so, the straight-eared cats are invaluable in the breeding program. Scottish Fold kittens are all born with straight ears, and somewhere around three or four months, the ears will start to fold on some kittens. 
<br> <br>
Whether folded or straight eared, Scottish Fold cats make excellent pets, loving and intelligent. </a>
